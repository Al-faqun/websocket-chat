# websocket-chat
This is a websockets chat example on php and js. It's made for training purposes, it's not production-ready, nor will it ever be. And it's architecture leaves much to be desired.

How to install:
1. Swoole installs as php extension, see the link: https://www.swoole.co.uk/docs/get-started/installation
2. Chat server launches as cli application: 'php websocket-server.php'. Chat.html, css and main.js must be placed somewhere in www/htdocs of apache/nginx/whatever webserver you use.
